Scope ===>> let,const,var
let and const are block scoped
var are function scoped 
laxical scope:- inner function access the variable of their outer function
hoisting    
ex: console.log(num)
let num = 6 // it give error due to temporal deadzone  //in this case it is hoisted but not initialize
but in case of var it is hoisted and initialized
closure :- a closure is a function that remembers the value of variable from its outer function even if outer function has finished
