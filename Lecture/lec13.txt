Javascript is a single-threaded
--Simplicity
--DOM safety
--call stack
--sync-Async :->
--#Synchronous code runs line by line.
Each task must finish before the next one starts.
--#Asynchronous code does NOT block the next line.
It runs in the background and finishes later.

Task vs microtask : microtask queue Priority  first than task queue
JavaScript runs one thing at a time, but uses queues + event loop to feel fast.
-->Anonymous function:->An anonymous function is a function without a name, used when you don’t need to reuse it.
